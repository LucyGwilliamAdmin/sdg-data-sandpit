  <p> Primary and Lower secondary education completion rate is measured as the gross intake ratio to the last grade of lower primary/secondary education. It is calculated as the number of new entrants (enrollments minus repeaters) in the last grade of primary/lower secondary education,
  regardless of age, divided by the population at the entrance age for the last grade of primary/lower secondary education.</p> <p>GCSE attainment shows pupils who achieved a grade 4 or above in English Language, English literature and maths. Prior to the introduction of reformed 9 to 1
  graded GCSEs (2017), GCSE attainment shows pupils who achieved 5+ A*-C including English and maths. GCSE attainment calculated as a percentage of all pupils at the end of key stage 4. </p>

data_footnote: >-
  <p>1. Primary and Lower secondary completion rates do not adjust for students who drop out during the final year of education. Thus this rate is a proxy that should be taken as an upper estimate of the actual completion rate. </p>
  <p>2. There are many reasons why the primary and lower
  secondary completion rate can exceed 100 percent: the numerator may include late entrants and overage children who have repeated one or more grades of primary education as well as children who entered school early, while the denominator is the number of children at the entrance age for
  the last grade of primary education.</p>
  <p>3. GCSE attainment data is for All Schools.</p>
