  Percentage of women aged 15−49 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when used in
  combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.

  Prevalence of anaemia and/or mean haemoglobin in women of reproductive age were obtained from 303 population-representative data sources from 116 countries worldwide. Data collected from 1990 to 2016 were used. A Bayesian hierarchical mixture model was used to estimate haemoglobin
  distributions and systematically addressed missing data, non-linear time trends, and representativeness of data sources. Full details on data sources will be available in WHO’s forthcoming report on anaemia prevalence: Trends in anaemia in women and children: 1995 to 2016 (WHO, 2017).
  Full details on statistical methods may be found here: Global, regional, and national trends in haemoglobin concentration and prevalence of total and severe anaemia in children and pregnant and non-pregnant women for 1995–2011: a systematic analysis of population-representative data
  (Stevens et al, 2013). Data and information for the UK has been obtained from multiple sources in order to fit into the model. This data varies in sample sizes and coverage but has been used for this model. Confidence intervals are availabe in the source data This indicator has not been
  identified in collaboration with topic experts.

Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. It negatively affects cognitive and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes
