  <p>The UK has reported annual spend from its Official Development Assistance (ODA) budget that it has assessed as having clear climate change objectives. All of reported UK climate finance is ODA. Core/general contributions that the UK cannot specify as climate specific are not included
  in these figures. The UK has provided the majority of it's climate finance via grants.<p>100% of Green Climate Fund contributions are counted as as climate specific. The Global Environment Facility has a wider remit than climate and this has been accounted in the amount scored as climate
  specific. For the purposes of reporting  these climate specific contributions have been split as 50% adaption and 50%mitigation. Contributions through other channels are identfied as climate specific when they are assessed as having clear climate change objectives.<p>Building on the
  provision of £3.87 billion in International Climate Finance (ICF) between 2011/12- 2015/16, the UK committed to further scale up climate finance to at least £5.8 billion between 2016/17-2020/21. Since parties to the UNFCCC committed to providing new and additional fast-start finance from
  2010, the scale up in climate finance was accompanied by a significant scale up in UK ODA from £7.3 billion in 2009 to £14.6 billion in 2018. UK Climate Finance committments therefore represents a new, dedicated climate commitment which is additional to historic ODA levels. The UK has
  furthered this commitment through a recent announcement of £11.6bn in ICF from 2021-2025.<p>The UK has categorised spend to multilaterals and bilaterals as ‘committed’. The reported finance is the amount recorded as spent for UK Government budgetary purposes. Therefore spend that has
  been pledged or committed for future years is not included. Spend using promissory notes is accounted for. These represent a legal promise for the UK to provide the total value of the promissory note, to the note’s recipient.<p>The [UK 2020 Climate Finance
  Results](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/international-climate-finance) (under 'Our Results') reports the International Climate Fund (ICF) results achieved against key performance indicators between the financial years 2011/12 and 2019/20.</p> Data follows the UN specification for this
  indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
