  Official Development Assistance (ODA) is provided according to the standardised definitions and methodologies of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s (OECD) Development Assistance Committee (DAC). ODA is defined as resource flows to developing countries and
  multilateral organisations, which are provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies, where each transaction is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective and is concessional in
  character. More information on DAC and ODA can be found on the [OECD website](http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). <br> <br>Poverty reduction ODA flows include basic social
  services and development food aid. These can be identified from the total ODA flows by Creditor Reporting System purpose codes (Sector Purpose Code/CRS codes) as follows <br> <br>-Basic Education (CRS codes 112xx) <br>-Basic Health (CRS codes (122xx) <br>-Water Supply and Sanitation
  (CRS codes 140xx) <br>-Multisector aid for basic social services (CRS code 16050) <br>-Development Food Aid (CRS code 52010)
computation_calculations: >-
  <p>The UK is a donor country, so the indicator represents the sum of bilateral ODA grants that focus on poverty
  reduction (based on the specified CRS codes) as a proportion of the UK’s gross national income (GNI). </p> The GNI value prior to 2013 is reconstructed from the total ODA:GNI
  ratio data in Table C1 for 2019 in Source 1. Using the information from Table C1, GNI for a given year (pre-2013) = (Net ODA/ODA:GNI ratio)x100. From 2013 onwards the exact GNI value is obtained from Table 1 in Source 1 (including the historic publicatiuons).

  Latest poverty reduction ODA flows data (2017 to 2019) are obtained from table "Data underlying the SID publication" (see relevant CRS codes in National Metadata tab). Previous data (2009 to 2016) is available from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/statistics-on-international-development-2017">SID for 2017</a> <br> <br>GNI values are obtained/calculated from Table C1. UK Net ODA 1970-2019 (£ millions) and Table 1 - GNI estimates and  ODA to GNI ratios; Current Prices for 2018 and 2019. Previous data for Table 1 can be found through the [Statistics on International
  Development page](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/statistics-on-international-development), for the relevant year.

  The gross national income (GNI) used for the proportion calculations is the same GNI number (based on current methodology in given year) as the GNI used for the ODA to GNI ratio calculations for UK SDG indicators 17.2.1 and 17.3.1. The Office for National Statistics publishes GNI values,
  but for consistency purposes the values used for these calclations were obtained from the FCDO publications (Source 1) Data follows the UN specification for this indicator. This indicator has not been identified in collaboration with topic experts.
