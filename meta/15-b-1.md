  The Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines official development assistance (ODA) as resource flows to developing countries and multilateral organisations, which are provided by official agencies (e.g. the UK Government) or their executive agencies, where each transaction is
  administered for the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries and is concessional in character. More information on DAC and ODA can be found on the [OECD website](http://www.oecd.org/development/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/officialdevelopmentassistancedefinitionandcoverage.htm). <br> ODA
  recipients are broken down in groups according to their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita - Least Developed Countries (LDCs), Lower-middle Income Countries (LMICs), Upper Middle Income Countries (UMICs), and Other Low Income Countries (Other LICs).
computation_calculations: Part a) of this indicator is calculated as the sum of all UK ODA in a target year that have a SectorPurposeCode (CRScode) = 41030. This code relates to ODA  flows that have
  biodiversity as a principal or significant objective.
